    "INTRO": "Introduction",
    "INTRO1": "This Final Degree Project (TFG) focuses on the development of a computer system, applying good software development practices and agile methodologies. Throughout the project, various phases were addressed, from planning and analysis to implementation and evaluation, with the aim of creating an efficient and adaptable system.",
    "INTRO2": "The project establishes the context and objectives, both technical and academic. The technical objectives include creating a system that improves the efficiency and quality of software development, while the academic objectives focus on the practical application of theoretical knowledge acquired during the degree.",
    "INTRO3": "The agile methodology was adopted for the development of the project, allowing flexible and dynamic management through sprints. Tools like GitHub, TogglTrack, Google Calendar, and Google Chat were used for efficient organization and detailed progress tracking.",
    "INTRO4": "An audit of the team's good practices was conducted, focusing on Bluejay and TPAs (Team Performance Assessments), including an exploration of visualizations in Grafana and a manual for creating custom widgets.",
    "INTRO5": "The system analysis defines the objective and describes its architecture and functional design, addressing both frontend and backend and providing a comprehensive view of its design and functionality.",
    "INTRO6": "The system implementation is described in detail, including the development environment and the technology stack used, as well as specific implementation details such as translations, local file management, and test case execution.",
    "INTRO7": "Manuals for deploying and using the system are included, offering detailed instructions for deployment in development, production, and application mode, as well as a reference guide for the configuration file and a tutorial on the TPA creation cycle.",
    "INTRO8": "The document concludes with an analysis of the issues encountered during development and proposes solutions and future work, highlighting the importance of agile methodologies in software development and the value of the practical application of theoretical knowledge.",
    "INTRO9": "In summary, a detailed and structured overview of software project development is provided, from introduction and methodology to implementation and user manuals, concluding with an analysis of problems and proposals for future work.",
    "RESEARCH": "Graph Research",
    "RESEARCH1": "The visualizations of the Bluejay dashboard are done in Grafana. To do this, we could use the basic visualizations included in Grafana or use external visualizations. To delve into this, a research was carried out to know the graphs that were available by default in Grafana, those that needed an external plugin, or those that required creating this external plugin.",
    "RESEARCH2": "This research yielded the following results:",
    "RESEARCH3": "That is, 1 in 3 graphs has native support already integrated in Grafana, 28.33% require some plugin that has already been created, and 38% have no native support or created plugin, although it would be easy to create a plugin using chart libraries like Highchart for this.",
    "PROJECTSTRUCTURE": "Project Structure",
    "PROJECTSTRUCTURE1": "The application is divided into two main parts: the frontend developed in Angular and the backend in Express. Both are designed to be modular, scalable, and maintain a clear structure. Additionally, the frontend interacts with its own API (backend), the GitHub API, and the Bluejay API, allowing for a wide range of functionalities and efficient integration with external services.",

    "PAGESSTRUCTURE5": "Page Structure",
    "PAGESSTRUCTURE6": "The page displays all saved metrics in two large tables: one for metrics related to the TPA and another for individual metrics not related to any specific TPA. Each row in the table includes the metric name and buttons to view, execute/edit, and delete the metric. Additionally, there is a section to create new metrics by entering the content in a text area and saving them as JSON.",
